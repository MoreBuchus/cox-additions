# CoX Additions

Additional QOL features for CoX.

Commonly asked about features:
- Olm side highlight is similar to what players do with NPC indicators where they mark the head to see what side Olm spawns. This option makes a 1x1 tile in the cetner of Olm's head and then disappears once Olm is fully up.
- The true tile list only works with NPCs that are in CoX. It will not work with NPCs that appear outside of it.
